java SkipList    

 For this project, I will create a simple spatial database for handling inserting, deleting, and performing queries on a collection of rectangles. The data structure used to store the collection will be the Skip The Skip List fills the same role as a Binary Search Tree in applications that need to insert, remove, and search for data objects based on some search key such as a name. The Skip List is roughly as complex as a BST to implement, but it generally gives better performance since its worst case behavior depends purely on chance, not on the order of insertion for the data.
